YCSB
1. For setting up the YCSB benchmarks - clone git, then compile it using maven

2. Using workloadc to get the number of ops/second

JZMQ:
ZMQ.poll -> 3rd argument creates issues.
New jzmq has problems with the way it is built as jar. Add external folder on the org.

Usage:
java -Djava.library.path=./jzmq-installed/lib/ -jar LoadBalancer.jar tcp://*:5555 tcp://*:5556
java -Djava.library.path=./jzmq-installed/lib/ -jar StorageNode.jar tcp://*:5556 tcp://*:4555 3 3 jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dac shriram ""
java -Djava.library.path=./jzmq-installed/lib/ -jar StorageNode.jar tcp://*:5556 tcp://*:4556 3 3 jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dac1 shriram ""

TODO Main:
Data Model - As of now, naive - A new data model because we are storing metadata without duplication, How much data will be reduced if I store this way.
PUT semantics - Read Accumulo
Enhance Consistent Hashing
EC2 - Performance + Application

Access Control: 
Role Based Access Control - Set bits for roles to indicate Read, Write?
Administrator can set access control on table when it is created.
During PUT, his roles are checked to see if he has permission to put. If he has, he sets the authorizations for the object.
PUT - will send his authorizations as well as user specified authorizations.

TODO:
Redistribution of keys after a new worker is added.
Heartbeat should be a separate thread.
Load Balancer - getNextWorker() - optimistic 
same way of creating identity depends on that.
nodeToHandle is REQ socket
How to prove replication - semantics of PUT
