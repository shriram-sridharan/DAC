YCSB
1. For setting up the YCSB benchmarks - clone git, then compile it using maven

2. Using workloadc to get the number of ops/second

JZMQ:
ZMQ.poll -> 3rd argument creates issues.
New jzmq has problems with the way it is built as jar. Add external folder on the org.

Usage:
java -Djava.library.path=./jzmq-installed/lib/ -jar LoadBalancer.jar tcp://*:5555 tcp://*:5556
java -Djava.library.path=./jzmq-installed/lib/ -jar StorageNode.jar tcp://*:5556 tcp://*:4555 3 3 jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dac shriram ""
java -Djava.library.path=./jzmq-installed/lib/ -jar StorageNode.jar tcp://*:5556 tcp://*:4556 3 3 jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dac1 shriram ""

TODO Main:
Data Model - As of now, naive - A new data model because we are storing metadata without duplication.
PUT semantics - Read Accumulo
Enhance Consistent Hashing
EC2 - Performance + Application
How much data will be reduced if I store this way.

Access Control: 
Role Based Access Control - Set bits for roles to indicate Read, Write?
Administrator can set access control on table when it is created.
During PUT, his roles are checked to see if he has permission to put. If he has, he sets the authorizations for the object.
PUT - will send his authorizations as well as user specified authorizations.

For Presentation:
User Based Access Control
Live Demo in the presentation + Graphs of time taken
consistent hashing - MD5 Hash of objects and key
replication - first send then replicate - coordinator
Presentation - Setup as Motivation + Implementation + Evaluation
Motivation - 
1. Need to convince why this idea is important and what is the potential value in this idea.
 => Add dynamoDB latest addition to Fine Grained Access Control.
2. Decoupled allows ability to change/represent the access control data model in a concise manner + give more sophisticated access control mechanisms.
Eg: put, get in accumulo.
3. Small demo in 838 with a web application.
Get, Put handled - not delete, create/alter

TODO:
Redistribution of keys after a new worker is added.
Heartbeat should be a separate thread.
Load Balancer - getNextWorker() - optimistic 
same way of creating identity depends on that.
nodeToHandle is REQ socket
How to prove replication - semantics of PUT
